Fork a Bash script for github.com/x URL:s 
Original idea for https://github.com/persand
https://gist.github.com/1370410

Some modifications to original Shit because when function calls, not sending the parameters and the option if [ -n "$ 2" ] is not validated and jumped default option 1.

Parameters are now stored in variables and used within the main function.

Thanks to Chicosoftware (https://github.com/chicosoftware) for testing
